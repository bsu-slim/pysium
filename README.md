# Simple Incremental Update Model (Python)

### Requirements

- nltk
- pandas
- sqlite3
- sklearn
- pandasql

### Installation

Clone the repository, then run `sium_test.py`

### Usage

Unfortunately, I don't have command line arguments, but it's easy to integrate into your own python script. Refer to `sium_test.py` for an example.
